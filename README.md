# Employee Manager

Hello !
This web application supports four basic functions of persistent storage and sorting records

## General info

Employee Manager provides creating, reading, updating, deleting and sorting records from employee database.
I've made it during Spring & Hibernate online course. I've added and changed a few things, furthermore I utterly understand how all things are working in this application, so I decided to share my work.

### Technologies

- Java 11
- Spring 5
- Hibernate 5.4
- MySQL 8.0
- HTML 5
- CSS 3

#### Setup

For now, this app works only locally, so you need to start with creating database by using my scripts, then open my project by IDE compatible with frameworks like Spring and Hibernate. There is servlet "TestDbServlet.java" where you can check connection with database

##### Remarks 

I'm aspiring backend developer, so please don't judge front end part :)
